The driving directions included statements like, _Continue on Main Street until you see a church on your right_ and _If the street is blocked because of construction...._ These statements are known as __control structures__, and they change the flow of the program's execution from a simple sequential order to a more complex and more useful flow."

        "Another elementary programming concept is the while control structure, which is a type of loop. A programmer will often want to execute a set of instructions more than once. A program can accomplish this task through looping, but it requires a set of conditions that tells it when to stop looping, lest it continue into infinity. A __while loop__ says to execute the following set of instructions in a loop _while_ a condition is true. A simple program for a hungry mouse could look something like this:\n",

        "```\n",

Similarily, the number of times the set of instructions in the while statement is executed changes depdending on how much food the mouse finds.\n",
        "\n",
        "Another variation on the while loop is an until loop, a syntax that is available in the programming language Perl (C doesn't use this syntax). An __until loop__ is simply a while loop with the conditional statement inverted. The same mouse program using an until loop would be:\n",

The second section is like a while statement using the counter, _While_ the counter meets this conditions, keep looping. The third and final section describes what action should be taken on the counter during each iteration. In this case, _i++_ is a shorthand way of saying, _Add 1 to the counter called i_.\n",
