# *__Control Structures__*

Without control structures, a program would just be a series of instructions executed in sequential order. This is fine for very simple programs, but most programs, like the driving directions example, aren't that simple. The driving directions included statements like, _Continue on Main Street until you see a church on your right_ and _If the street is blocked because of construction...._ These statements are known as __control structures__, and they change the flow of the program's execution from a simple sequential order to a more complex and more useful flow.
