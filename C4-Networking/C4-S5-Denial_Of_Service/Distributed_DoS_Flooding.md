# *__Distributed DoS Flooding__*

A _distributed DoS_ (__DDoS__) attack is a distributed version of a flooding DoS attack. Since bandwidth consumption is the goal of a flooding DoS attack, the more bandwidth the attacker is able to work with, the more damage they can do. In a DDoS attack, the attacker first compromises a number of other hosts and installs _daemons_ on them. Systems installed with such software are commonly referred to as _bots_ and make up what is known as a _botnet_. These bots wait patiently until the attacker picks a victim and decides to attack. The attacker uses some sort of a controlling program, and all of the bots simultaneously attack the victim with some form of flooding DoS attack. Not only does the great number of distributed hosts multiply the effect of the flooding, this also makes tracing the attack source much more difficult.
