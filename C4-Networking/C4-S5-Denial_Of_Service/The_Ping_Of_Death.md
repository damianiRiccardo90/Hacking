# *__The Ping of Death__*

According to the specification for ICMP, _ICMP echo_ messages can only have $2^{16}$, or _65,536_, bytes of data in the data part of the packet. The data portion of ICMP packets is commonly overlooked, since the important information is in the header. Several operating systems crashed if they were sent ICMP echo messages that exceeded the size specified. An ICMP echo message of this gargantuan size became affectionately known as _“The Ping of Death.”_ It was a very simple hack exploiting a vulnerability that existed because no one ever considered this possibility. It should be easy for you to write a program using _libnet_ that can perform this attack; however, it won’t be that useful in the real world. Modern systems are all patched against this vulnerability. 

However, history tends to repeat itself. Even though oversized ICMP packets won’t crash computers anymore, new technologies sometimes suffer from similar problems. The Bluetooth protocol, commonly used with phones, has a similar ping packet on the _L2CAP_ layer, which is also used to measure the communication time on established links. Many implementations of Bluetooth suffer from the same oversized ping packet problem. Adam Laurie, Marcel Holtmann, and Martin Herfurt have dubbed this attack _Bluesmack_ and have released source code by the same name that performs this attack.
