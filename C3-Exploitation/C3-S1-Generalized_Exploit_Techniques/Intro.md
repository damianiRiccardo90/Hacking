# *__Generalized Exploit Techniques__*

Off-by-one errors and improper Unicode expansion are all mistakes that can be hard to see at the time but are glaringly obvious to any programmer in hindsight. However, there are some common mistakes that can be exploited in ways that aren’t so obvious. The impact of these mistakes on security isn’t always apparent, and these security problems are found in code everywhere. Because the same type of mistake is made in many different places, generalized exploit techniques have evolved to take advantage of these mistakes, and they can be used in a variety of situations.

Most program exploits have to do with memory corruption. These include common exploit techniques like buffer overflows as well as less-common methods like format string exploits. With these techniques, the ultimate goal is to take control of the target program’s execution flow by tricking it into running a piece of malicious code that has been smuggled into memory. This type of process hijacking is known as _execution of arbitrary code_, since the hacker can cause a program to do pretty much anything he or she wants it to. Like the LaMacchia Loophole, these types of vulnerabilities exist because there are specific unexpected cases that the program can’t handle. Under normal conditions, these unexpected cases cause the program to crash—metaphorically driving the execution flow off a cliff. But if the environment is carefully controlled, the execution flow can be controlled—preventing the crash and reprogramming the process.
